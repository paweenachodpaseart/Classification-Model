Weather Forecasting Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### 📌 Project Overview 
This project focuses on using Machine Learning with Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict weather conditions based on temperature, humidity, air pressure, and wind speed, with the goal of accurately forecasting rain or snowfall.

### 🎯 Objectives
1. Develop a weather forecasting system: Use SVM to predict rain or snowfall based on temperature, humidity, air pressure, and wind speed data.
2. Improve accuracy: Compare the performance of different kernels to find the best method for forecasting.
3. Assist decision-making: Use the forecast data to prepare for potential weather conditions.
   
### 🛠️ Tool: Google Colaboratory(Python)
